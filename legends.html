Zhenniao were mentioned in many myths but also even encyclopedias and historical records.

It could eat fire, so it was considered protection against fire disasters and placed all over buildings to ward off fires. It also could make judgements on people, making it a symbol for official government buildings like the National Assembly. </div>
